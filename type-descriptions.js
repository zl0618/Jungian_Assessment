            en: "These types are guided by profound, often symbolic inner images and archetypal patterns. Their orientation to life is visionary: they sense the underlying currents and inevitable directions of events, often long before others do. This \"inner seeing\" is not vague fantasy, but a focused, almost prophetic perception of what is to come, which they strive to realize through effective, objective action. Their auxiliary extraverted thinking gives them a practical, systematic approach to manifesting their visions—they are not content to dream, but must bring order and structure to the world in accordance with what they have foreseen. They may appear enigmatic, intense, or even aloof, as their attention is so often absorbed by the compelling reality of their inner world. They are often misunderstood, as their motivations are shaped by images and meanings that are difficult to articulate. In adaptation, they excel at long-term strategy, innovation, and transformation, but may struggle with the demands of the present moment or with the emotional needs of others.",
            zh: "這些類型被深刻的、通常是象徵性的內在圖像和原型模式所引導。他們對生活的取向是有遠見的：他們感知到事件的潛在趨勢和不可避免的方向，通常遠早於其他人。這種「內在的看見」不是模糊的幻想，而是一種專注的、幾乎是預言性的對即將到來之事的感知，他們努力通過有效的、客觀的行動來實現這些洞見。他們的輔助外向思維賦予他們一種實用的、系統化的方法來實現他們的願景——他們不滿足於夢想，而必須根據他們所預見的來為世界帶來秩序和結構。他們可能顯得神秘、強烈，甚至冷漠，因為他們的注意力經常被內在世界的引人入勝的現實所吸收。他們經常被誤解，因為他們的動機是由難以表達的圖像和意義所塑造的。在適應方面，他們擅長長期策略、創新和轉型，但可能在應對當下時刻的需求或他人的情感需求方面遇到困難。"

            en: "NIFE types are deeply attuned to the symbolic and archetypal meaning of life, but their insights are expressed through empathy, diplomacy, and a desire to inspire or guide others. They often have a sense of personal destiny or calling, and seek to harmonize groups or communities around a vision that feels both inevitable and meaningful. Their auxiliary extraverted feeling makes them sensitive to the emotional climate and needs of others, and they may become the \"conscience\" or \"prophet\" of their circle. They are often reserved or mysterious, as their perceptions are difficult to translate into everyday language, but they radiate a quiet conviction and warmth. They may struggle when their inner vision is misunderstood or when they feel disconnected from collective values.",
            zh: "NIFE類型深深地調和於生活的象徵和原型意義，但他們的洞察力通過同理心、外交手腕和激勵或引導他人的願望來表達。他們經常有個人命運或使命感，並尋求圍繞著既感覺不可避免又有意義的願景來協調團體或社群。他們的輔助外向情感使他們對他人的情感氛圍和需求敏感，他們可能成為自己圈子的「良心」或「先知」。他們經常保守或神秘，因為他們的感知難以轉化為日常語言，但他們散發著一種安靜的信念和溫暖。當他們的內在願景被誤解或當他們感到與集體價值觀脫節時，他們可能會遇到困難。"
