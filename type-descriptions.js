            en: "You are fundamentally oriented toward understanding the deep, underlying patterns and archetypal structures that govern life and human experience. Your consciousness is drawn to profound inner visions and symbolic images that seem to reveal the inevitable direction of future events. Unlike those who focus on immediate realities, you perceive life through the lens of what Jung called primordial images - universal patterns that have repeated throughout human history. This visionary capacity gives you an almost prophetic sense of where things are heading, often years before others catch on. However, you're not content to simply contemplate these insights in isolation. You feel a powerful compulsion to manifest these visions in the external world through systematic, objective action. Your auxiliary extraverted thinking provides you with the practical tools to organize, structure, and implement your inner revelations, transforming abstract archetypal understanding into concrete systems and institutions that can serve humanity.",

You risk becoming tyrannical when your vision encounters resistance, since the archetypal patterns feel so inevitably true to you.",
